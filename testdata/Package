Description: 3D chess for X11
 3 dimensional Chess game for X11R6.  There are three boards, stacked
 vertically; 96 pieces of which most are the traditional chess pieces with
 just a couple of additions; 26 possible directions in which to move.  The
 AI isn't wonderful, but provides a challenging enough game to all but the
 most highly skilled players.
